**_【Overall Writing Requirements】_**

**_1. Identify the target audience:_** _Clearly identify the intended audience: developers/product managers/architects._

**_2. Confirm content to include:_** _Introduce what the **feature/module** is (What), what it can do (Why), and how to develop it (How)._

**_3. Take the developer's perspective:_** _From a developer’s point of view, provide the relevant and necessary content for development._

**_4. Task-oriented writing:_** _Focus on the tasks developers need to complete, with practical guidance._

**_5. Do not be restricted:_** _This template is for reference only. Adjust flexibly according to actual needs._

## Introduction to xxx (Specific Feature/Module Name)

_What is this feature/module (definition – what)? What problems does it solve or what value does it bring (customer value – why)?_

_**【Writing Tips】**_

_Refer to scenario-based writing, using the SCQA approach as follows:_

- _S: situation – start with a familiar situation or fact._  
- _C: complication – describe the mismatch between reality and expectations.Highlight the mismatch between reality and expectations._  
- _Q: question – How?_  
- _A: answer – Our solution is..._

```C
xxxxx
```

## Development Process

**_【Writing Tips】_**

_Optional._

- _How can developers use this feature/module (How)?_

- _Follow a layered structure: Scenario (task) → Task Logic (development flow) → Step-by-step instructions._

- _If there are many steps, provide a flowchart._
